The doctype tag needs to go to top of every html page you write. Means we are intending this doc to be modern html, prevents bugs <br>


<h1>My HTML notes</h1> <br><br>
<em>Hi there!</em> <br>
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language <br>
<p> Markup is a form of text that can be interpreted
in a certain format for design purposes. It includes references,
which could be videos, links, etc.</p>

Definitions <br>
<p>Markup - code that tells the browser what
the text on a web page should look like</p>
<p>Hypertext - text that can have links or references</p>
<p>Nesting - the idea that some bits of code can go inside other
  bits of code</p>
<p>Syntax - the grammar rules of language </p><br><br>
p is a block element, br is an inline element. The browser constructs
invisible boxes around the elements. <br>
Note that p does not need a closing tag, it is optional, the browser will figure out
the closing tag on its own<br>
The br is a void element, so unlike p, it has no contents <br>
Misc. <br>
<p>Any text editor that uses plain text works for writing code</p>
<br>
sub vs. sup <br>
subscript and superscript<br>
H<sub>2</sub>O

<br><br>
<em>italic</em>
<strong>boldface</strong>
<mark>highlighting</mark>
<br>
Us h1 through h6 for headlines<br>

<h3>The div element:</h3>
A block level element<br>
Div is short for division, you can divide page into different sections<br>
div has invisible box around it, like p; and can also be formatted<br>
p is specifically for text, div is generic and contains whatever
<h3>Lists:</h3>
ol and ul always need closing tags, li does not<br>
ol is ordered list - with numbers<br>
<ol>
  <li>dog
  <li>cat
</ol>
ul is unordered list - with bullets<br>
<ul>
  <li>dog
  <li>cat
</ul>
li and p have optional closing tags, browser figures out where to close it because the
browser knows there has to be a start tag when it gets to
the start tag of a new element that cant be inside the last one. For example, when it gets
to a new p element, it knows previous p element must be closed<br>
<h5>Nested List Example</h5>
<ul>
  <li>good
    <ol>
      <li>dogs
      <li>boats
    </ol>
  <li>bad
    <ol>
      <li>cats
      <li>movies
    </ol>
</ul>
<p>remember to use indentation to show which elements are nested <em>inside</em>
  other elements</p>

<h3>Web Addresses</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Protocol
  <ol>
    <li> http - insecure, needs domain name
    <li> https - insecure, needs domain name
    <li> file - works for <em>your own</em> cpu
  </ol>
</ul>
<h3>Links</h3>
Use the a for anchor tag, a is an inline element - it does not create a box on the page <br>
href - hypertext reference <br>
Add a link to your favorite website <br>
<a href="http://www.azimutyachts.com">Azimut Yachts</a><br>
A fully qualified url must be used, which inludes http <br>
<h3>Adding Images</h3>
src is source of image, where image is from <br>
alt is text displayed if image is not found <br>
img is a void element, an empty element, img is inline element <br>
To create an image that is a link, put an img element between the open and close tags of an a element <br>
<a href="https://google.com"><img src="googlelogo.png" alt="Google"></a><br>
Note: The image in the anchor MUST BE in your HTML file folder...in this case it is Udacity Intro to Programming folder <br>
<h3>Files and Relative URLs</h3>
a URL without a :// is always treated as a relative URL, cpu thinks its the name of a file <br>
for a link to refer to a website, it has to be an absolute url with http <br>
Attributes always go <em>inside</em> of the anchor, attributes include alt, src, href<br>
play with size of image like https://placebear.com/100/200 the numbers<br>

<h3>Head and Body</h3>
head includes title, style, scripts, metadata search engines <br>
body refers to everything else <br>
if you dont include head and body tags, the browser will attempt to place them
in your code itself <br>
so head elements must appear first, body after <br>
you cant have a head element such as title in the middle of your document

<h1>CSS</h1>
<h3>CSS Vocab</h3>
DOM-Document Object Model-tree structure with node for each HTML element, text, image, any other object <br>
Selectors-part of css ruleset, indicate which html element the rule is for <br>
Declaration blocks-other part of css ruleset, say how rule will modify elements indicated by selectors <br>
CSS rules-composed of a selector followed by a declaration block <br>
type-simplest kind of selector. Indicates the name of one type of HTML element such as em or li <br>
class-an attribute that groups elements together that you want to have the same style <br>
id - an attribute that must be unique to a single element <br>
